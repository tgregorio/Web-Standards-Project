	<h1>Spring Lake Elementary Project Analysis</h1>
</header>

<div id='main'>
	<h2>Site Intent</h2>

		<p>The redesigned Spring Lake Elementary website should provide quick and easy 
		access to the school’s calendar, the school’s policies, easy access to purchasing 
		uniforms and supplies online, and a form for contacting the school with any 
		questions or concerns.</p> 
		<p>The redesign should also feature the school’s message, accolades, and the 
		technology currently in use. This information will help parents doing research on 
		multiple schools understand what sets Spring Lake Elementary apart from other area 
		schools.</p>

	<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
	
		<p>Local area private schools, such as <a href=http://www.parkmaitland.org/>
		Park Maitland School</a> and <a href=http://www.centeracademy.com/>
		Center Academy</a>, have URL’s directly referencing the school in them, which 
		makes the site easier to get back to without needing a bookmark. Spring Lake 
		Elementary is a subdomain of ‘K12.fl.us’. Not only does this add complexity to 
		the URL, but it also makes the URL more difficult to remember without a bookmark.
		</p>

		<p>Some keywords that popped up in research that should be attached to the SEO are 
		“Seminole County schools” and “Compare and Contrast”. This implies users may be 
		looking for the best school in the area.</p>

	<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
		<p>The site’s predominant audience are mothers ages 35-44 (though the audience is 
		as high as 55-64). Based on this information, the site should serve as a companion
		tool for those with children enrolled. Information such as the school calendar 
		should be displayed prominently on the home page along with contact information
		(via phone, fax, or online form).</p>

		<p>For parents doing research, a dedicated “About Us” section should detail the 
		school’s history, accolades it has received, and technology in use. This section 
		will not only be informational, but also serve as a ‘pitch’ to convince parents 
		Spring Lake Elementary is a great place to have their kids enrolled.</p>
