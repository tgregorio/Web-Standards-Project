		<h2>Superior Education for over 45 YEARS!</h2>
		<p>Spring Lake Elementary was established in 1966 and has provided 
		Seminole County with outstanding education ever since. The school is 
		located in Altamonte Springs, Florida, which is about 15 miles outside of 
		Orlando, Florida. Spring Lake has been a Five Star School for the past 5 years. 
		Our Principal, Mr. Alex Agosto and Assistant Principal, Ms. Kimberly Lochrane are 
		committed to setting a standard of excellence. The current focus for 
		Spring Lake Elementary is the revitalization of classroom instruction utilizing 
		current technology and research to promote positive collaboration, enhance 
		learning and create a respectful climate that will encourage students to reach their 
		learning potential.</p>
		<h2>Technology in the Classroom</h2>
		<p>Spring Lake Elementary is one of the leading elementary schools in technology 
		integration. Teachers and students use computers and technology as a part of 
		their daily curriculum. Each classroom has an average of three computers and the
		school has three labs with 28 computers in each for student use and one mini lab 
		with 15 computers. Our <strong>SuccessMaker Labs</strong> are used to allow 
		students in Grades 1-5 to practice math and reading skills aligned with the 
		Next Generation Sunshine State Standards for their grade level.</p>
